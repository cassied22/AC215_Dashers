# Deployment Details

All instructions for setting up Google Cloud Virtual Machines (GCP VM) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Ansible playbooks can be found in the main branch's [`README.md`](../../README.md). This page focuses on the logistics behind these structures. The `inventory.yml` file contains the specifications of our project. YML files prefixed with `deploy-k8s-*` are playbooks for Kubernetes setup, while the other YML files are playbooks for Virtual Machine setups. When a Continuous Deployment (CD) action is triggered, the container in GitHub Action executes `deploy-k8s-update.sh` to run Kubernetes playbooks and redeploy necessary changes on other containers.

We choose to use Kubernetes to increase the scalability of our app. Kubernetes provides automated scaling capabilities through horizontal pod autoscaling, which dynamically adjusts the number of running pods based on resource usage or custom metrics. This ensures the application can handle varying loads efficiently, optimizing both performance and cost. Additionally, Kubernetes supports self-healing mechanisms, such as restarting failed pods and automatically rescheduling workloads across healthy nodes, improving reliability and uptime. Its declarative configuration model enables seamless updates and rollbacks, reducing the risks associated with deployment changes. With Kubernetes, we can manage complex microservices architectures and handle traffic spikes without compromising performance or requiring manual intervention, making it an ideal choice for building scalable, robust, and resilient applications.
